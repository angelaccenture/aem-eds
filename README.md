* Authors can move blocks up and down, delete them, duplicate blocks
* Authors can add blocks into a section, change grid, styles, background

### Templates
* Create templates or customizing the existing ones within the /templates folder

## Patterns

### Page
A page is what holds your content. It can be styled using a metadata property called `template` which will load styles that apply to the entire page.

### Section
A section is a sub-section of your page. It can be styled using a `section-metadata` block. A section will control the layout of blocks.

### Block
Blocks are children of sections. A block adds visual context to parts of a page.

### Auto Block
An auto block is a block generated from a pre-defined piece of content. Often times from a link that matches a particular pattern. Link-based auto blocks can be helpful when additional nesting of content is required.

### Default content
Default content is content that lives outside a block.
